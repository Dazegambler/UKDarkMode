# UKDarkMode
Turns off all Lights on the level and you'll only have a flashlight to navigate through the level in Ultrakill
# Description

WARNING:THIS MOD IS RESOURCE INTENSIVE AND WILL REDUCE YOUR FRAMERATE A BIT, I'M TRYING TO MAKE IT AS OPTIMIZED AS POSSIBLE.

Current Issues:

1.V2 not having the correct shader applied(Not surprised at this point)
